# Missing color formats
- OMX.IMG.VIDEO.TOPAZ.Encoder - color formats 0x7F000005-12 (although 1-3 are probably incorrect, too)
- MediaTek S900/MT9950 - 0x7F000101-3
- color formats from HiSilicon? (not sure if they have their own or if thry "borrow" Qualcomm's formats)

# Missing profile and levels
- MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ (at least on Xiaomi 13T Pro) has a non-standard 0xC000 profile and 0xC30D level for its APV codecs
